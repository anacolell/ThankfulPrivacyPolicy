# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the Thankful app (hereafter referred to as "Application"), a mobile device service created by Ana Colell (hereafter referred to as "Service Provider"). This service is provided free of charge and is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use

The Application does not require users to create an account, and therefore, does not collect, store, or have access to any personally identifiable information except as detailed below:

We do not store or share any of your journal entries or app data in any format remotely.
Your data is stored locally on your device. This means that if you uninstall the Application, all stored data will be deleted and cannot be recovered.

## Customer Support

When you request support via email or through our customer support contact form, we collect your email address. We use this information exclusively to communicate with you regarding your support request, feedback, or important information.

## Third Party Services

The Application utilizes third-party services that have their own privacy policies.

**Expo**:
Expo is a platform that enables developers to build and update iOS, Android, and web apps from a single codebase. It simplifies app development by providing access to pre-built functionalities and APIs for features like push notifications and updates.

**Google Play Services**:
Google Play Services provides Android apps with access to Google functionalities such as authentication, synchronized contacts, and location services. It enhances app performance and user experience by enabling features that support better integration with the Android ecosystem.

## Data Retention Policy

Since the Application stores all user data locally and does not collect personal information, data retention by the Service Provider does not apply. Users are responsible for managing their data stored on their device.

##Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## Your Consent

By using the Application, you are consenting to our data practices as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.
